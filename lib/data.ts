      "answer": "Red Gold Geode is a beautiful round artwork that catches your eye with its bright red color, like a shiny ruby. The red is mixed with swirls of gold, light brown, and a bit of white, making it look smooth and flowy, just like the inside of a real geode. There are small, shiny stones stuck into it—some are black, some are pinkish-brown, and others are yellowish-green. These stones are placed in neat, wavy lines, giving the art a bumpy texture and making it feel more real. Thin gold lines separate the different parts, adding a fancy touch and showing off all the little details. It’s placed on a soft white cloth, which makes the red and gold colors pop even more. Red Gold Geode is a lovely piece that brings the beauty of nature into your home in a simple, eye-catching way."

Made using the real flowers from your varmala, this frame is a special way to remember your wedding forever.

    {
      "question": "Timeline",
      "answer": "Your varmala preservation frame will be delivered in 12–14 business days.  We take around 7–8 days to carefully dry and preserve your real varmala flowers. After that, 1–2 more days are spent on the final touches, like polishing and detailing, to make your frame perfect.  Every piece is made with love and care, so we don’t rush the process. From flower preservation to the finishing shine, each frame has its own journey.  We promise — the wait will be worth it."
